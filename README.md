# Bulma's Brief Snippets

The brief way to use the Bulma CSS framework. This extension was made because the other Bulma snippet extensions I've found for VSCode aren't quite what I need. In particular, I wanted a way to simply generate the CSS link to a copy of the Bulma CSS file on a CDN, as well as the necessary Font Awesome JavaScript call. For now, that's all this extensionw will do, but I might add more functionality in the future.

## Features

The following snippet(s) are available.

| Prefix | Result |
|---|---|
| bulma-links | Includes CSS and JavaScript for Bulma and Font Awesome. | 

## Known Issues

* It's too brief.

### 0.1.0

Initial release of Bulma's Brief Snippets. Right now it just generates the necessary CSS and JavaScript links.
